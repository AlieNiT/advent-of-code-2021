# What is [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)?

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can 
be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training,
university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

# What am I doing here?

I'm currently working on the problems in Advent of Code 2021, and considering the fact that you can't upload your codes
on their website, I thought it'd be a good idea if I uploaded them on GitHub.
